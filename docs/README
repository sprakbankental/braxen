# README

The Braxen documentation is written in modularised AsciiDoc. 

The contents of the docs folder is as follows

docs/
--adoc/   The documentation source.
--html/   A HTML rendition of the documents.
--images/ Image library.
--pdf/    A PDF rendition of the documentation.

The asciidoc folder contains the documentation proper, 
amd is the authoritative version in case of discrepancies.

To view the AsciiDoc source:

- GitHub renders AsciiDoc, but will not do includes or 
  substitutions, so the result is less than enjoyable and 
	often incomplete.
- Locally, you can use the AsciiDoctor.js plugin to view
  the docs directly in your browser. 
	Editors such as VS Code also have plugins that will
	let you read previews directly.
- Install asciidoctor, or run through a Docker image.

But generally it will be easiest to go for the HTML or 
PDF versions.
